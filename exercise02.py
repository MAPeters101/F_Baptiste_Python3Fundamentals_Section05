Exercise 2
Concatenate the following tuples into a single one, but replacing the odd value
s with zeros (0).

t1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
t2 = 7, 8, 9, 10
t3 = 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
You can assume that every tuple is a sequence of consecutive integers starting
with an odd integer.

Try to write your code to be as generic as possible.
